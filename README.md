# Prolog Family Tree Program

This repository contains a simple Family Tree system implemented in Prolog.
The project is part of an academic assignment exploring logical inference,
recursive rules, and relationship modeling using Prolog.

## Features

- Basic family facts:
  - parent/2
  - male/1
  - female/1

- Derived relationships implemented using rules:
  - grandparent/2
  - sibling/2
  - cousin/2
  - descendant/2 (recursive)
  - ancestor/2

- Sample queries demonstrating logical inference

## How to Run

1. Install SWI-Prolog: https://www.swi-prolog.org
2. Load the Prolog file:
